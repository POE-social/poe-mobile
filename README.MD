## Overview

Poe uses the [Solana Mobile Stack](https://github.com/solana-mobile/solana-mobile-stack-sdk), [Splinglabs](https://github.com/spling-labs/social-protocol) and [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) to bring to life a new form of social media rewarding users for doing climate-friendly actions and enabling them to build their metaverse in the process. We bring real-world companies into the mix by giving them the opportunity to sponsor the prizes that users use to build and enhance their metaverse.
